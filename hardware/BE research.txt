According to the above documentation, a webhook feature is implemented so that TTN can send application related messages to
specific REST api endpoints. Currently, webhook is deactivated - can reactivate through TTN, but cannot access base URL.

Wiki states that BE is NextJS based (i.e. no Express), but package.json only has Express installed.

Need ENV values.

What is a webhook and how does work for our project:
- parses data sent from the CO2 devices when uploaded to TTN
- Checks if a new device exists in the DB (will create one or upload data to device model)

BE setup:

Jest - JS test framework for mocking and code coverage for FE and BE
Axios - for fetch reqs
Firebase - user management and storage
Express - builds and manages server-side app (HTTP reqs, middleware, routing, etc)
Helmet - Node middleware to secure Express app
Cypress - FE testing
Prettier - code formatting
