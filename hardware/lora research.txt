Set up steps:

1. Clone https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-LoRa-Series.git
2. Run IDE as admin
3. Install XPowersLib, U8g2, LoRa (By Sandeep Mistry), and esp32 libraries
4. Add keys to config ?


New steps:

1. Plug in board and press reset button.
2. Run IDE as admin
3. Open File -> Preferences, then click the icon next to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" section and pase the following: https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
4. Click "Ok" twice
5. Click the COM port you're using and edit -> Select 'TTGO LoRa32-OLED' + Your COM port -> Ok
6. Install XPowersLib, U8g2, RadioLib, and esp32 libraries 
7. Open LoRaWAN_Reference
8. Open config.h tab
9. Edit the TTN keys and region info (Lines 24-42, subBand = 2)
10. Update the line near the top declaring the radio variable. If using the LilyGo T3 V1.6.1, you can update it with the following:
```
SX1276 radio = new Module(18, 26, 23, 33);
```
11. In TTN, go to Applications -> CO2 Sensors -> End Devices -> [Your sensor name here] -> General Settings -> Join Settings, and click "Reset Used DevNonces"
12. Go to "Live Data"
13. Upload to the board. This will take a while to finish uploading. Watch the Live Data tab to see your device join the network.
14. Open Serial Monitor in IDE to see the connection process and monitor any errors. Refer to https://jgromes.github.io/RadioLib/group__status__codes.html for any errors that come up.
Give it 2 tries to first join. Will join successfully on second try.


Did:
- Added 1.6.1 pinout
- Adjusted config to work for 1.6.1
- Changed interval times and join delay
- Added EEPROM storage functionality (used for lorawan 1.0.4 onwards)
