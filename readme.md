CO2 Project

This is a project to rewrite the system for the Co2 systems at Otago Polytech as the one that is currently set up is a bit old and could do with being updated.
The Co2 systems are used to check levels in some of the classrooms as some can get quite high and need windows open all year round.

It is being written in React, and will use Docker to run virtual containers.
